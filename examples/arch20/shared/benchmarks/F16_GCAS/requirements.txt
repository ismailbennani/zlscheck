Initialization:
    Add "AeroBenchVV-master" folder to Matlab path. 


Inputs:

    Initial conditions for roll, pitch, and yaw in the ranges below
       Xrange = [pi/4+[-pi/20 pi/30]; -(pi/2)*0.8+[0 pi/20]; -pi/4+[-pi/8 pi/8]];


Requirement:
	Never hit the ground
    â–¡_[0 15] (altitude>0)

Initial altitude (InitAlt) is set to 4040. 

Possible extention: Increasing "InitAlt" to 4050 and activate "model_err" to apply an error to the model
and  solve it as a challenge problem.
