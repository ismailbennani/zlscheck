    and Adolfo Anta, ARCH 2016

Initialization (MATLAB variables):

See run_staliro.m

Inputs:
1) Any continuous signal with
        8.0 <= wind speed <= 16.0

2) Any piecewise constant function with control points for each 5 seconds.
        8.0 <= wind speed <= 16.0

Requirement (time horizon: 630)

    1. always_[30, 630] BladePitchAngle_Deg <= 14.2
    2. always_[30, 630] 21000 <= Mg_d <= 47500
    3. always_[30, 630] Omega_rpm <= 14.3
    4. always_[30, 630](possibly_[0,5]
        |BladePitchAngle_Deg - Theta_d_deg| <= 1.6)
