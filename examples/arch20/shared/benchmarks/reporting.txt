Reporting Falsification Results
-------------------------------

Terminology
- experiment: running the falsification tool once on a single requirement for a given model for a maximum number of simulations
- simulation: number of invocations of the "sim" function for the entire time horizon of the benchmark (or similar)

Last year we ran 50 experiments with max 100 simulations each to account for statistical variance.

Suggested data to be collected from each experiment

- benchmark model, requirement
- falsification success: did the tool find a falsifying input with the given maximum number of simulations?
- total wall clock time for this experiment
- best (lowest) achieved robustness score
- in case of success
  - number of simulations actually required
  - the concrete input signal(s) achieving the falsification

Rationale: if we have individual data points for all experiments and tools,
we can plot "nth fastest successfull result" vs "number of simulations required"
which gives a graphical illustration of the relative performance of the tools.

Suggested report format for inital parameters

    matlab_var = <value> % if it is just a top-level Matlab variable

Suggested report format for piecewise constant time varying inputs

    u = [t0 a0 b0 ...;
         t1 a1 b1 ...;
         ...
         tn an bn ...]

where ti are the time points with t0 = 0 and tn = simulation time horizon,
ai are the values of the first input signal,
bi are the values of the second input signal, and so on.

Such an array can directly be fed into the simulation
