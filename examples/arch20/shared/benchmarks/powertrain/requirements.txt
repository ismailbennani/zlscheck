AbstractFuelControl_M1

Description:
- Xiaoqing Jin, Jyotirmoy V. Deshmukh, James Kapinski, Koichi Ueda, Ken Butts:
  Powertrain Control Verification Benchmark, HSCC 2014.

- ARCH 2017 and 2018

Initialization (MATLAB variables):

    simTime        = 50
    measureTime    =  1
    fault_time     = 60
    spec_num       =  1 % compute mu
    fuel_inj_tol   =  1
    MAF_sensor_tol =  1
    AF_sensor_tol  =  1

Inputs:

Only instance 2)
    piecewise constant with 10 segments
         0.0 <= throttle and throttle <= 61.1 (normal mode)
        61.2 <= throttle and throttle <= 81.2 (power mode)
    constant
        900 <= engine and engine < 1100

    IMPORTANT: feedforward power mode is entered at throttle = 61.2 so make sure this is *excluded* from the input range

Requirement (time horizon: 50)

    (27) from [HSCC 2014] in normal mode

    always_[11, 50]
        ((rise or fall) ==> (always_[1,5] (abs(mu) < 0.008)))

where

    rise = (throttle <  8.8) and (eventually_[0, 0.05] (throttle > 40.0))
    fall = (throttle > 40.0) and (eventually_[0, 0.05] (throttle <  8.8))

Requirement (time horizon 50)

    (29) from [HSCC 2014] in normal mode

    always_[11, 50] abs(mu) < 0.007

    (33) from [HSCC 2014] in power mode

    always_[11, 50] abs(mu) < 0.007
