Initialization

    u_ts = 0.001;

Inputs: always 1 <= Ref and Ref <= 3 and 
    1. Piecewise continuous with consecutive discontinuities (steps) at least 3 seconds apart  

    2. Piecewise constant input signal with 3 segments
        
Simulation time 40s.

Requirement:
    There are two parameters alpha=0.005 beta=0.03

    □_[1.0, 37.0] ( (abs((Pos - Ref)) > (alpha + (beta * abs(Ref)))) ==> ◇_[0.0, 2.0] □_[0.0, 1.0] !((alpha + (beta * abs(Ref))) <= abs((Pos - Ref))))

Alternative definition
    # Output is close to the reference signal
    param alpha=0.005
    param beta=0.04
    # param beta=0.03 # More difficult
    close_ref := abs(Pos[t] - Ref[t]) < alpha+ beta*abs(Ref[t])
    reach_ref_in_2s := ev_[0, 2] (alw_[0, 1] (close_ref))

    # At all times, Output will be close to the reference signal within 2 seconds
    NNreq: alw_[1., 37] ((not close_ref) => reach_ref_in_2s)

Potentially more difficult values (open to debate)
    beta \in {0.03,0.04} or alpha \in {0.005, 0.006, 0.007} (the higher the more difficult)
