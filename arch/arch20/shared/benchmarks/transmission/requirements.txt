Description:
Bardh Hoxha, Houssam Abbas, Georgios Fainekos
Benchmarks for Temporal Logic Requirements for Automotive Systems
ARCH 2014

Inputs:

    1. Any piecewise continuous signal subject to the constraints
          0 <= throttle and throttle <= 100
          0 <= brake and brake < 350
       
    2. Piecewise constant signals subject to the constraints
          discontinuity only possible every 5 seconds 
          0 <= throttle and throttle <= 100
          0 <= brake and brake < 350
           
Simulation time is 50s. 

Requirements:

    The specific choice of parameters is such that falsification is possible.
    Some requirements are easy (for humans/for some algorithms),
    some others may be hard e.g., for random sampling.

    Note: the requirement numbers refer to Table 1 in the publication.

    AT2 here concerns the engine speed RPM only.

    There are a few variants for AT6 and it is written a little bit different.
    Feel free to reformulate into the original form
        not ( (eventually_[0,T] speed > ...) and (always RPM < ...) )

    Gidon: the parameters and requirements are up to debate

    □ = always
    ◇ = eventually

    AT1:  □_[0.0, 20.0] (speed < 120.0)
    AT2:  □_[0.0, 10.0] (RPM < 4750.0)
    AT51: □_[0.0, 30.0] ((!(gear == 1.0) && ◇_[0.001, 0.1] (gear == 1.0)) ==> ◇_[0.001, 0.1] □_[0.0, 2.5] (gear == 1.0))
    AT52: □_[0.0, 30.0] ((!(gear == 2.0) && ◇_[0.001, 0.1] (gear == 2.0)) ==> ◇_[0.001, 0.1] □_[0.0, 2.5] (gear == 2.0))
    AT53: □_[0.0, 30.0] ((!(gear == 3.0) && ◇_[0.001, 0.1] (gear == 3.0)) ==> ◇_[0.001, 0.1] □_[0.0, 2.5] (gear == 3.0))
    AT54: □_[0.0, 30.0] ((!(gear == 4.0) && ◇_[0.001, 0.1] (gear == 4.0)) ==> ◇_[0.001, 0.1] □_[0.0, 2.5] (gear == 4.0))
    AT6a: (□_[0.0, 30.0] (RPM < 3000.0) ==> □_[0.0, 4.0] (speed < 35.0))
    AT6b: (□_[0.0, 30.0] (RPM < 3000.0) ==> □_[0.0, 8.0] (speed < 50.0))
    AT6c: (□_[0.0, 30.0] (RPM < 3000.0) ==> □_[0.0, 20.0] (speed < 65.0))
