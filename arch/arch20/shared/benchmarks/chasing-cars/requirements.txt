Chasing Cars

Description:
There are five cars, which run toward -infty.  The first car is controlled by inputs, Throttle and Brake.  Other cars are driven by the algorithm used HSSC2000 paper above.
The outputs, y1, ..., y5 indicate locations of cars 1 to 5.  Simularion starts at t = 0 and ends at t = 100.

Inputs:
1) Any piecewise continuous signal with finite discontinuites and finite variability with
        0 <= Throttle <= 1.0
        0 <= Brake <= 1.0

2) Any piecewise constant signal with control points for each 5 second.
        0 <= Throttle <= 1.0
        0 <= Brake <= 1.0


Requirements:
Requirements are artificially created to measure impact of complexities of formulas.  Some instances are easy, but some may be very hard.

        Fml1: always_[0, 100] y5 - y4 <= 40
        Fml2: always_[0,70] possibly_[0,30] y5-y4 >= 15
        Fml3: always_[0,80] ((always_[0,20]y2-y1<=20) or (possibly_[0,20]y5-y4>=40))
        Fml4: always_[0,65] possibly_[0,30] always_[0,5]y5-y4 >= 8
        Fml5: always_[0,72] possibly_[0,8]((always_[0,5] y2-y1 >= 9) -> (always_[5,20]y5-y4>= 9))
